# Testing In PHP Exam Project
A project PHP project created with Symfony. MVC architecture, used PHPUnit to write tests for controller. A simple 'caclulcator' logic covered with indepth unit tests.

To sum up everything: used symfony and PHPUnit frameworks. Tests include mocking controllers and object, data-driven tests (data providers), edge cases, static function situations, code-coverage. Documentation was made with Given/When/Then style in mind. The project only covers one controlelr, so all of the tests can be found in [CalculatorControllerTest.php](https://github.com/Armandulis/Testing-In-PHP-Exam-Project/blob/main/tests/Contorllers/CalculatorControllerTest.php)
